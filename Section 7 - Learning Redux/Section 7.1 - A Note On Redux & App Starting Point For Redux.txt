A Note On Redux & App Starting Point For Redux
----------------------------------------
- Redux is a State Manager and gives us the ability to have application level State.
- The Context API demonstrated how useful it is to have all your State in one place and to be able to access it through all of your components.
- The Context API is great for smaller applications where you do not have too many resources (e.g. the contactmanager app we built which only has a contact resource).
- Redux was created for managing a larger application State for example an e-commerce website which has products, categories, customers, authentication etc.
- Redux consists of a:
   1) Store - holds the applications global state.
   2) Reducers - functions that manipulate the state.
   3) Actions - makes calls to the Reducer.

- We will be using the previous contactmanager app as a base but have stripped out all the Context API code as we will be using Redux.
