REACT INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------
What is React?
- Client Side JavaScript Library (i.e. runs on the clients machine in the browser).
- Created & maintained by Facebook.
- Used to build dynamic user interfaces.
- Renders everything as a "component".
- Often referred to as the "V" (View) in MVC.

Library or Framework!
- Is often called a framework and is comparable to other frameworks.
- However, React is technically a Library (because it is missing a few key components that most frameworks include e.g. a router, HTTP etc.)
- Tools can be added for routing and HTTP request etc. for example React Router, Fetch API, Axios and Redux.
- Closer to Angular/Vue than something like jQuery.

Why Should You Learn React?
- Makes JavaScript easier
- Organises your UI
- Reusability
- Scalability & Efficiency
- Lighter than most other frameworks
- GET A JOB!

ENVIRONMENT SETUP
----------------------------------------
- A Text Editor: Visual Studio Code or Atom.
- Install NodeJS (comes with NPM - Node Package Manager) from https://nodejs.org/en/
- We will use NPM to install Create React App which is the CLI for creating React Application Projects and we will also use NPM to install other smaller packages.
- Install git for a version control system.
- Install React Developer Tools and Redux DevTools for your browser (i.e. install from Chrome Web Store for Chrome Browser).

- I will be using VSCode as my text editor. Some useful Extensions to have installed are:
   > Bracket Pair Colorizer
   > ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native Snippet
   > Live Server
   > Prettier - Code Formatter

- Go to the settings in VS Code and add custom user settings for Prettier:
   "editor.formatOnSave": true
   //"prettier.tabWidth": 3, (Optional)
   // "prettier.singleQuote": true (Optional)
- The settings above override the default settings (formatOnSave and singleQuote are turned off and tabWidth are set to 2 by default). You do not necessarily need to have prettier to have formatOnSave turned on but this would mean you need to press cmd+shift+p on your keyboard and enter >Format Document for prettier to format your document.

- Finally, go to the settings in VS Code and add custom user settings for Emmet:
   "emmet.includeLanguages": {
      "javascript": "javascriptreact"
   },
   "emmet.syntaxProfiles": {
      "javascript": "jsx",
      "javascript": "html"
   }
