SECTION 1.4 - INSTALLING & USING THE CLI
----------------------------------------
- We will learn how to: 
   >run the create-react-app CLI tool
   >generate our application
   >run the dev server

How to run create-react-app CLI tool:
1) Open up your teminal/command line.
2) run the following code to see if you have npm installed:

   > npm --version

This should log the version should npm be installed on your machine. If not install nodejs/npm following the web link and installation guide:
   https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
   https://nodejs.org/en/

3) run the following code to install create-react-app globally:

   > sudo npm install -g create-react-app
   > password: enter your PC User password to install.

4) To generate a new React application run the following code (ensure you are within the directory you wish to create the new React App e.g. cd to your desktop etc.):

   > create-react-app NameOfApplication

NameOfApplication should be the name of your application. This will create the application in the destination directory. 

5) In your command line cd to your project file and open the file in VS code:

   > cd NameOfApplication
   > code .

If the code . command does not open VS Code, manually open the application. In VS Code you can go into your command palette by pressing cmd+shift+p and type in shell. Select the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH which will give you access to the code command.

6) To run the dev server enter in your terminal:

   > npm start

This will open your application in the browser automatically in http://localhost:3000/ with a simple React Welcome page.

7) In your terminal press ctrl+c to stop the dev server.

   > ctrl + c

8) When your ready to deploy your application and create your static assets you will run the following code:

   > npm run build

This will create a build folder within your project containing all your static assets/files you want to deploy to your web server.
