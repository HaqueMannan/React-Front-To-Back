404 PAGE NOT FOUND
----------------------------------------
- To create a 404 Not Found page in your application, go to your src/components/pages folder and create a new file called NotFound.js which will act as our 404 Page Not Found component which we can use in our App.js file.

NotFound.js File:
- You can design your 404 Page Not Found to look like whatever you want.

   import React from 'react';

   export default () => {
      return (
         <div>
            <h1 className="display-4"><span className="text-danger">404</span> Page Not Found</h1>
            <p className="lead">Sorry, that page does not exist.</p>
         </div>
      );
   };


App.js File:
- In order for this to work we need to bring in the component into our file and then within our <Switch> the very last <Route /> we create requires only the component property which will point to the {NotFound} component we created above.

   import NotFound from "./components/pages/NotFound";

   <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Contacts} />
      <Route exact path="/contact/add" component={AddContact} />
      <Route exact path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route component={NotFound} />
   </Switch>

- We do not require a path for the 404 Page. If we now try to enter a url where no route exists, this will display your 404 Page Not Found.
