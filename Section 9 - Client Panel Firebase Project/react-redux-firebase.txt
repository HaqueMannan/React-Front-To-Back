React-Redux-Firebase Setup
-----------------------------------

Github Guide Page:
https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase

In terminal within your project directory run the following command:
   > npm i redux react-redux react-redux-firebase redux-firestore firebase

These are the dependencies that we require for now in our application.

1) Redux for our Store/State Management
2) React-Redux which combines React with redux
3) React-Redux-Firebase which integrates with firebase and allows us to access our collections, auth etc.
4) Redux-Firestore which deals with the firestore database.
5) Firebase library itself.

These dependencies will be added to the package.json file as well as installed in the node_modules folder.
In the src folder we will create the store.js file which will hold the application intialState and store.
There will be a lot of boilerplate setup code but this will allow us with functionlity for our Web App.
