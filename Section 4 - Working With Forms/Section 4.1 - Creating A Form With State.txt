CREATING A FORM WITH STATE
----------------------------------------
- In our src/components/contacts folder we are going to create a new AddContact.js file which will be our form to add a new contact.
- The AddContact.js will be a class based component and we will import this to our App.js file above the <Contact /> element.
- When you create a form, in most cases each field/input is going to be a piece of the state.

AddContact.js file:

   import React, { Component } from 'react';

   class AddContact extends Component {
   state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: ''
   }

   render() {
      const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

      return (
         <div className="card mb-3">
            <div className="card-header">Add Contact</div>
            <div className="card-body">
               <form>
                  <div className="form-group">
                     <label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
                     <input type="text" name="name" className="form-control form-control-lg" placeholder="Enter Name..." value={name} />
                  </div>
                  <div>
                     <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
                     <input type="email" name="email" className="form-control form-control-lg" placeholder="Enter Email..." value={email} />
                  </div>
                  <div>
                     <label htmlFor="phone">Phone</label>
                     <input type="text" name="pone" className="form-control form-control-lg" placeholder="Enter Phone..." value={phone} />
                  </div>
                  <input type="submit" value="Add Contact" className="btn btn-light btn-block" />
               </form>
            </div>
         </div>
      )}
   }

   export default AddContact;

- You will notice that when we try to type into our form fields we are unable to enter anything. The reason for why we cannot enter anything into our form is because it is now a controlled component. When you set a value on an input it is now a controlled component and needs to be set to your state.
- However, we need to set an eventHandler for onChange i.e. when we start to type into our input field, this should fire off an onChange. We would then need to associate that onChange event with the input for a function that will change that particular State value when we start to type. The default State value is an empty string.
