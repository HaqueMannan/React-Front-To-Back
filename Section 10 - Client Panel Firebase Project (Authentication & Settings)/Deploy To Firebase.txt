DEPLOY TO FIREBASE
-------------------------------------
- To deploy your application to Firebase, sign into your firebase account and go to your project overview page.
- Click on the Hosting tab and click on the Get started button. This will tell you to install Firebase Tools by going into your console and entering the command:

   $ nmp install -g firebase-tools

- Enter the following command in terminal in your project directory:

   $ firebase login

- It may ask whether firebase CLI can collect anonymous usage and errors - this is entirely upto you. Select yes or no.
- When your browser launches this will ask you to login to your gmail account. The Firebase CLI will want to access your google account. Click allow. In your terminal it should return login successful.
- You will now be able to init your project by typing the following command:

   $ firebase init

- You will get some questions which you can navigate with the arrow keys and the spacebar to select.
- We would want to select firestore and hosting (we are not using firebase real-time database, cloud functions or cloud storage - so we can leave these unchecked). Hit enter on your keyboard. 
- This will ask which default Firebase project you would like for the project (select the reactclientpanel or whatever you called your firebase project).
- Hit enter to use the default for Firestore Rules and Firestore Indexes.
- What do you want to use as your public directory? This part is important because when we build out our app with react it will put it in a folder called build. By default firebase will use public. Therefore, we would want to specify in this question build and press enter.
- Configure as a single-page app? We want to say yes.
- Firebase initialization is complete!

- Go back to firebase in your browser click next and it will require you to perform your first deploy. Go back to your terminal and enter the following command:

   $ npm run build

- This will create the build files. We would then be ready to deploy the build files using the following command:

   $ firebase deploy

- You application will be available on the internet using the following firebaseapp.com link generated by firebase. To create a domain name for your web application we can click on the Connect domain button and add it in there.
Note you will need to register to a domain. Recommended to use namecheap to find a cheap domain name:
